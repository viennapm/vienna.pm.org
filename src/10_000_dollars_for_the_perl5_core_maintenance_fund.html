[% title = 'Vienna.pm donates $10,000 for Perl 5 Core Maintenance' %]


<p>The <a
href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl_5_core_maintenance_fund">Perl 5 Core
Maintenance Fund</a> initally aims to raise $25,000 to to pay for Nicholas
Clark and Dave Mitchell to work for 3 months on the Perl 5 core, fixing bugs
and making other improvements.</p>

<p>Vienna.pm decided to set aside $10,000 as "match funding" - ie for every $1
that someone else donates, Vienna.pm donate $1, until $10,000 + $10,000 is
raised, and only 20% remains to reach the target. The hope is that "match
funding" will encourage people to donate a bit more themselves than a simple
unconditional donation.</p>

<p>We again would like to thank all <a href="http://vienna.yapceurope.org/ye2007/team.html">organisers</a>, <a href="http://vienna.yapceurope.org/ye2007/sponsors.html">sponsors</a>, <a href="http://vienna.yapceurope.org/ye2007/talks">speakers</a>, and <a href="http://vienna.yapceurope.org/ye2007/stats">attendees</a> of <a href="http://vienna.yapceurope.org/ye2007/">YAPC::Europe 2007 in Vienna</a>, who made all this possible in the first place!</p>
